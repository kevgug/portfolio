## Concert

This Wednesday, I spent the night before my neuroscience exam at a Balu Brigada concert. One of the brothers of the performing duo, Henry or Pierre, said something unassumingly profound towards the end of the show. So even if I score below average on that exam, I might have gained something more valuable and lasting, other than enjoying the concert with a friend, of course.

He announced they were about to perform _Butterfly Boy_—not the most popular song on their new album, but one that best reflects how they are, at their core, just a pair of vulnerable guys. While this song is explicitly about vulnerability, I think all art is built on the foundation of vulnerability.

> Without vulnerability, even the most expressive content is not art.

If my claim is true, then creativity alone isn't enough to call something valid _art_. But what exactly is vulnerability and why does it make something art?

## Explainer

So Why does vulnerability matter? there's only one of us, one life.
Creativity is necessary but insufficient. Vulnerability is necessary but insufficient, too. Only creation can be automated. Vulnerability depends on singularness and impermanence/time-constraint of life: reputational risk and opportunity cost.

We can create artificial scarcity in the lives of AI personas that delineate their output. e.g., a Twitter bot. There are no stakes in the reputational risk.

Vulnerability requires the impermanence of the artist.

## Performative vulnerability

Consider these three verses. Only one is a real verse in _Butterfly Boy_, while the others are AI generated lyrics. Would you consider one more **vulnerable** than the other?

<br>

**Sample A**:

> I broke down at the grocery store, the weight\
> Of all these expectations pressing down\
> Too hard—I'm learning it's okay to not be great\
> At holding up the world when I might drown\

**Sample B**:

> And it's better to feel something than nothing\
> But the fragility is killing me with\
> Skin thinner than a butterfly\
> Mood swinging with the changing tides again\

**Sample C**:

> They see someone who's supposed to have it all\
> But I'm just colors bleeding in the rain\
> I'm terrified of mirrors in the hall\
> That show me someone I can't quite explain

<br>

Assuming you don't already know the song
Would you surprised if I told you the correct verse was sample A? Or sample C? Assuming you haven't heard the song before, I presume you would've simply accepted either as fact, even though they're both AI generated. Ignoring All are comparably expressive

It's about making associations. It's all about perception.

- You can be deceived, only if you're (1) told a lie and (2) believe it. Deceit means you've made a false association between some creator and the creative piece.
- If you're (1) told a lie and (2) don't believe it, then you don't make the association between the supposed creator and the creative piece.
- If you're (1) told the truth and (2) don't believe it, then you also don't make the association between the actual creator and the creative piece.
- If you're (1) told the truth and (2) believe it, then you've formed a correct association between the actual creator and the creative piece, which we can now call the artist and the art.

Here is a 2x2 matrix summarizing these scenarios:

|                   | **Creator was vulnerable**   | **Creator was not vulnerable** |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Believe**       | Correct association<br>→ Art | False association<br>→ Art     |
| **Don't believe** | No association<br>→ Not art  | No association<br>→ Not art    |

Performatively vulnerable ≠ truly vulnerable.

Older generations may be used to associating a creative output with a human creator, so they automatically believe. This either creates a correct association to a human creator (artist), which is what they're used to, or a false association between the creative piece and a non-existent human creator (AI). Once they're made aware of

## Generalizability

How about something not explicitly vulnerable? All

Music
Acting
Writing
Drawing
Painting
...

Also: entertainment, sports (which often go hand in hand)

## We value vulnerable gift giving more

Why do inexpensive but thoughtful gifts mean much more to the recipient than expensive gifts? Why does a handwritten birthday letter mean much more to us than a 'happy birthday' text message? The obvious reason is the extra time investment—for choosing that personal gift or handwriting that card—signals care for the recipient. It is worth noting that signaling care for someone is socially costly: imagine the social embarassment from signalling care for someone who doesn't think much of you. Therefore you are being vulnerable. The fact that we generally prefer the inexpesnive but thoughtful gift over the expensive gift shows that we value the giver's financial cost less than their social cost: we value when others are being vulnerable when providing us value. The tangible value is boosted by the intangible determined by the level of vulnerability of the giver.

Gift giving is highly analogous to art. While we might not ever personally know the creator, we know they are being vulnerable for people like us, and we appreciate that deeply.

## AI

Associating yourself with output is enough to satisfy the requirement for vulnerability. My dad generating song with Suno for my grandmother in French with specific details like the current date and names of family members. Does she understanding that no human created that song? Probably not; it is genuinely convincing and quite good. I'd argue that the claim of how much my dad prompted the model to produce that exact output doesn't matter—it only matters whether my grandmother forms the association that my dad produced the song, the means of production being irrelevant. So to my grandmother, the song is art. To me, the song is not art because I make more of an association to Suno than to my dad: I don't perceive much vulnerability, other than my dad claiming he created the song (because he prompted Suno with the specific details).

How about my other grandmother, who paints for a living. Knowing her, I have a direct association between her and her creative output.

It felt really sacriligeous doing this, but for research purposes, I AI generated new art in her style (sorry, grand-mère).

As for anyone else who knows my grandmother, my visceral feelings at seeing this are disgust. It feels unacceptable that

But how little work do I have to do before my association with the creative output is false? In other words, how little of the _creating_ can I get away with?

- Imagine that I painted that on canvas in the style of my grandmother, as an homage to her talent. I create everything from the pencil outline to the paint. I presume that would be well received.
- Now imagine I got AI to generate just the pencil outline for the painting. While less creative, I still go through the effort of copying over the pencil marks to the canvas by eye and painting in the gaps. I presume that would still be well received.
- Now imagine I got AI to generate the colors too; I would still have to go through the effort of sketching the pencil outline, mixing the acrylic paint to create the right color, and painting in the right gaps with the right mix of paint. It's still a decent bit of effort that shows I'm paying homage to my grandmother.
- Now imagine I also ask AI to tell me exactly which paints to buy and mix in exact amounts to match the colors on the AI generated reference painting. Now something's starting to feel a bit off—I'm no longer putting any active thinking into the creation of the painting. But following all those steps over likely hundreds of shades of paint still reflects effort and would probably be appreciated by my grandmother.
- The next step is where things break down: imagine I print out the AI generated painting onto canvas using an art studio printer. Other than the financial cost of printing the painting, I haven't put any considerable effort into the output. Additionally, the gesture will likely come across less as a thoughtful gift and more as a "hey, look how easy it is for anyone to replicate your art and print it as if it were a real print!"
- The most extreme version is I AI generate the painting and send her the piece in an email. I don't think anyone would expect any appreciation for that.

At which point is association between me and the output broken? It's when I don't need active thinking. Because active thinking means I'm openly expressing my thoughts, which is vulnerable. If i'm not openly expressing my thoughts to the recipient, then I am not being vulnerable, and there is no social cost related to my thoughts if my grandmother doesn't like the imitation piece. Ironically there will still be social cost, only its due to signalling my lack of appreciation for the joint creative skills, sure, but also vulnerability she has to go through to create her piece.
