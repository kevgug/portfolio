## Overview

When writing is a means to an end, LLMs become a crutch rather than an advisor.

we trust large language models over human cognition.
AI use is non-negotiable.
AI-enabled perfectionism is non-negotiable.
it becomes a question of how, not whether, to use AI.

The standardised evaluation of an essay—as for the grading of a college essay—disproportionately shifts the reward from the writing process to the writing output.

quality-conforming output

I try to be intentional about how I spend my time. The time I spend writing should be no exception. Therefore, I am holding myself accountable to all Aims, Do’s, and Don’ts enumerated in this document.

In effect, I'll consider the manifesto as the brand guidelines for my personal writing.

## Aims

- Become better at expressing my thoughts.

- When the temptation is to use AI tools to perfect my writing, I might enjoy finding signal in the rough of my natural thinking.

- Influence the direction of technology to a more utopian state in a way that’s practical and feasible, socially and economically.

As a byproduct, these aims will each serve as hypotheses for the benefits of writing online.

## Do’s

- Paint an honest and ideally optimistic view of the future of technology.

- Think both high level and low level. High level thought paints an optimistic view of the future, while low level thought proposes one bridge to get there.

- Be curious

- Attempt to answer the low level questions. No one holds every answer and I’m no exception. I just view it like this. If everyone shared their imperfect attempts at a realistic path to a better future that embraces tech, we have many fragments of great ideas to choose from. So rather than fear my own arrogance, I should have a genuine stab at the low level implementation of my vision.

- Force myself to research topics I otherwise wouldn’t. Treat it as college essays that hyperspecifically interest me (I’m deciding the topic of interest).

- But in my own writing style. Where college essays encourage homogeneity and verbosity, I am aiming for clarity of thought.

## Don’ts

In brand guidelines, we list what not to do (as much as what to do).
I want to establish the same for my writing.

- Do not edit the words or paragraph structure to sound smart. Only ever edit to be parsimonious.

- Do not use an AI tools for writing sentences or structuring my thoughts. Use AI tools exclusively for research that influences my ideas.

- Do not conform to the writing style of others. Focus first and foremost on getting my thoughts onto the page.

- Do not aim for my thoughts and insights to be impressive. Just share with the world what I otherwise think in private without compensation. But obviously only those ideas I think others might find value in reading.

- Do not spend more than three active days of writing time per essay. The more time I have to formulate my words, the more perfectionist I’ll get and the more I’ll try to perfect my thoughts themselses. Accumulate my ideas in conversation and everyday life and thinking, then get it out without excessive filter.

- Do not filter what I share, as long as I can’t foresee the ideas causing actual hurt to others. I will naturally make predictions that diverge from the status quo, so at most I might share a vision of the future that is uncomfortable for the resistant.

- Do not extrapolate from past essays out of perceived necessity. I can change my opinions as the data changes - it would be delusional to perpetuate an old belief before I reevaluate that old belief.

- Do not write to build an audience. I am writing to share my honest thoughts in the depth I have them.

- Do not fall for sunk cost fallacy. Just because I've written many paragraphs going down one branch of thought, doesn't mean I cannot discard that branch of thought if it later shows its assumptions to be false.

## Topics

I will write about whatever thoughts I naturally have, in whatever distribution I have them. I will not restrict myself to any one topic.

My approach is that I am _not_ writing for an audience. That would only restrict the domain of my thought. I am writing for myself alone. Then if I think that others could extract value from an essay, I will publish it online.

In so doing, I will write about what I care about. Which will increase the likelihood of meaningful ideas in my writing. So others are more likely to extract value from my essays.
