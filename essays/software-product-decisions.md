## Premise

The cost of AI writing code is rapidly falling to zero. As a result, the cost of building software products will fall to zero. Conveniently, inference cost is proportional to inference time, so AI is also becoming faster at writing code for software products. Once it takes me a day to build either the nth feature or all n features, at neglible cost, then good software has become a homogenised product. Just like food—similar in quality, similar in price—software will become difficult to differentiate.

We end up with two important questions. First, how do we differentiate software products if they're all functionally the same? My instinct tells me that the software product with the best story for an audience will win, like in food marketing, but this ignores data collection and network effects. Second, between engineers, designers, and PMs, who decides what AI must implement in code? My instinct tells me it's a combination of all three, but also that today's roles won't last into the next decade, so I have to determine how exactly humans add value to the software development process.

With my gut responses, we can think of better

One question is whether software products will only differentiate themselves by marketing. A more important question is who makes the product decisions—who directs AI on what the design and code of software should be?

Infinite domain and range of AI: need to ask the right product questions (domain) and build the needed safeguards (range); engineering is a safeguard for the probabilistic output of LLMs.

, just like good food under the monopolistic conditions of contemporary restaurants.

Consider parallels to existing monopolistic markets, like restaurant food. For the same dish in London, the cost of ingredients and labor , just like good food under the .

And if the cost is neglible, then

The most significant iteration is a large refactor.

When he only cost in software development will be permanent reputational damage.
