## About Me
Rising Junior at UChicago, blending imagination and engineering into human-centric software. Some of my work includes redesigning the TFDi's landing page (2x site traffic in one month) and winning the UChicago designathon (Most Well-Designed App, 2022).

I provide end-to-end software production, from user research and design to multi-platform development and marketing.
