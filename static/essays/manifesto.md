## Aims

Every piece of work I create should have intention behind it. This document captures that intention. These aims equally serve as my hypotheses of what I’ll gain from publishing essays online.

- Become better at expressing my thoughts.

- When the temptation is to use AI tools to perfect my writing, I might enjoy finding signal in the rough of my natural thinking.

- Influence the direction of technology to a more utopian state in a way that’s practical and feasible, socially and economically.

## Do’s

- Paint an honest and ideally optimistic view of the future of technology.

- Think both high level and low level. High level thought paints an optimistic view of the future, while low level thought proposes one bridge to get there.

- Be curious

- Attempt to answer the low level questions. No one holds every answer and I’m no exception. I just view it like this. If everyone shared their imperfect attempts at a realistic path to a better future that embraces tech, we have many fragments of great ideas to choose from. So rather than fear my own arrogance, I should have a genuine stab at the low level implementation of my vision.

- Force myself to research topics I otherwise wouldn’t. Treat it as college essays that hyperspecifically interest me (I’m deciding the topic of interest).

- But in my own writing style. Where college essays encourage homogeneity and verbosity, I am aiming for clarity of thought.

## Don’ts

In brand guidelines, we list what not to do (as much as what to do).
I want to establish the same for my writing.

- Do not edit the words or paragraph structure to sound smart. Only ever edit to be parsimonious.

- Do not conform to the writing style of others. Focus first and foremost on getting my thoughts onto the page.

- Do not aim for my thoughts and insights to be impressive. Just share with the world what I otherwise think in private without compensation. But obviously only those ideas I think others might find value in reading.

- Do not spend more than three active days of writing time per essay. The more time I have to formulate my words, the more perfectionist I’ll get and the more I’ll try to perfect my thoughts themselses. Accumulate my ideas in conversation and everyday life and thinking, then get it out without excessive filter.

- Do not filter what I share, as long as I can’t foresee the ideas causing actual hurt to others. I will naturally make predictions that diverge from the status quo, so at most I might share a vision of the future that is uncomfortable for the resistant.

- Do not extrapolate from past essays out of perceived necessity. I can change my opinions as the data changes - it would be delusional to perpetuate an old belief before I reevaluate that old belief.

- Do not write to build an audience. I am writing to share my honest thoughts in the depth I have them.

## Topics

I will write about whatever thoughts I naturally have, in whatever distribution I have them. I will not restrict myself to any one topic.

My approach is that I am _not_ writing for an audience. That would only restrict the domain of my thought. I am writing for myself alone. Then if I think that others could extract value from an essay, I will publish it online.

In so doing, I will write about what I care about. Which will increase the likelihood of meaningful ideas in my writing. So others are more likely to extract value from my essays.

## Accountability

I am holding myself accountable to all Aims, Do’s, and Don’ts enumerated in this manifesto. This document serves as the brand guidelines of my essays.

## Inspiration

I’m a strong believer in credit where credit is due. These are my three reasons for publishing my thoughts, new and old, online.

- Paul Graham.

- My friends who started writing two years ago, who have proven there is only upside in publishing your thoughts online.

- And to my friends who still have an unfounded embarrassment around sharing their writing, I hope this encourages you to publish your first piece.
